    description: 'CMPUT 174 and 175 use a problem-driven approach to introduce the fundamental ideas of Computing Science. Emphasis is on the underlying process behind the solution, independent of programming language or style. Basic notions of state, control flow, data structures, recursion, modularization, and testing are introduced through solving simple problems in a variety of domains such as text analysis, map navigation, game search, simulation, and cryptography. Students learn to program by reading and modifying existing programs as well as writing new ones. No prior programming experience is necessary. Prerequisite: Math 30 or 30-1. See Note (1) above. Credit cannot be obtained for CMPUT 174 if credit has already been obtained for CMPUT 274 or 275, except with permission of the Department.'

    description: A continuation of CMPUT 174, revisiting topics of greater depth and complexity. More sophisticated notions such as objects, functional programming, and Abstract Data Types are explored. Various algorithms, including popular searching and sorting algorithms, are studied and compared in terms of time and space efficiency. Upon completion of this two course sequence, students from any discipline should be able to build programs to solve basic problems in their area, and will be prepared to take more advanced Computing Science courses.
