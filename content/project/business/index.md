This is the project for CMPUT 301 F21 Team 08. The habit tracker app can let users to record their habits and help them keep track of these habits. It can prompt the user when to finish a habit and record the completion level of each habit. Users in this app can also add each other as friends. Friends can see the tracked habits of each other and the completion level of these habits as well. More functions are coming up!

**First Sprint: Oct.18 - Oct.24**

In this sprint, we focus on the structural implementation of the program. We divided the program into three function sections: login (user profile related), habit, and habit event. We only build the UI part for these three sections and realize the interaction between pages in this sprint. Pages related to "following" is not considered in this sprint.

Summary:
By the end of this sprint, the team did finish most of the required UI pages as planned. Two pages left undone is the main page (to-do list page) and the profile page. We set to finish these pages in the second iteration.

**Second sprint: Oct.25 - Oct.31**

In this sprint, we focus on realizing the actual functions of the three sections of the program within the sections themselves. We do not consider the interaction between functions in this section.
